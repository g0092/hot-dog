# Hot Dog identification with TensorFlow
They said: build something for fun! Create an app that uses machine learning to identify hot dogs vs. other foods! Be creative! So I found an inspiration: The Treachery of Images (French: La Trahison des images) is a 1929 painting by surrealist painter Ren√© Magritte. It is also known as This is Not a Pipe. The painting is sometimes given as an example of meta message conveyed by paralanguage, like Alfred Korzybski's "The word is not the thing" and "The map is not the territory", as well as Denis Diderot's: This is not a story. One interpretation is that the pipe in the painting is not a pipe, but rather a drawing of a pipe. So I did a parody of Magritte's work. Is that a hotdog? Isn't that a hotdog? Is that just an image? Is that just another food?
